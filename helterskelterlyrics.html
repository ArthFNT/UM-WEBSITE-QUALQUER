            [Verse 1]
            When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
            Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
            'Till I get to the bottom, and I see you again
            Yeah, yeah, yeah!
            
            [Bridge]
            Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?
            I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you (Aaaaah)
            Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer (Aaaaaaaaah)
            Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer (Dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer)
            
            [Chorus]
            Now, Helter-skelter

            [Bridge]
            Oh, will you, won't you want me to make you? (Aaaah)
            I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you (Aaaaaaaaah)
            Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
            You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer (Dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer)
